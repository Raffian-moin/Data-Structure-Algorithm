# Rearrange an array such that arr[i] = i

"""
Problem Statement:
Given an array of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N â€“ 1. 
All elements may not be present in the array. 
If the element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array. 
Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present, 
display -1 at that place.
